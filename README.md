# Readme for the SERV-VPU Project

As part of a Group Design Project at the University of Southampton we created a vector accelerator for the SERV core (https://github.com/olofk/serv).

There are several repositories in organisation:

- **vpu** : This repository contains a fusesoc (https://github.com/olofk/fusesoc) environment with our Vector accelerator and a SERV with the required modifications to interface with it.

- **Baremetal-Serv-Template** : This repository contains a hello world example for our Baremetal SERV compilation workflow.

- **Vector-Benchmark** : This repository contains the benchmark program we used to measure the effectiveness of our accelerator, it is adapted from this Neural Network Testbench (https://github.com/AI-Vector-Accelerator/NN_software).
